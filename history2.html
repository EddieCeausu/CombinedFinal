									<h1>Charles McClung McGhee</h1>
								</header>

								<p>Before and After the Civil War, Knoxville was rapidly growing. Merchants would line along Gay Street distributing products accumulated from rural and metropolitan areas. McGhee accumulated this wealth through a pork packing plant he inherited from his Father, Charles McGhee, and sold his product on Gay Street. During the War McGhee provided food heavily to the Confederate army, however, after the siege on Knoxville McGhee took allegiance with the Union in 1864.</p>

								<br />

								<p>After the war, McGhee accumulated his fortune similar to many of those around him. This included buying and selling railroads, stocks, and investing in companies to shape them to his benefit. An example of this was his purchase of the two major railroad lines in Knoxville, East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad and the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, which was later merged to the East Tennessee Virginia and Georgia Railroad.  Through this large and successful business venture, McGhee was able to acquire many Northern Financers located in New York.</p>
