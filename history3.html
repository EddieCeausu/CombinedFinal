									<h2>Buisness Ventures</h2>
								</header>

								<p>MgGhee's greatest buisness venture was the public library, which he gave in memorial to his daughter Lawson. The three story building at an estimated cost of $50,000, became known as the the most elegant building in the southern states (Knoxville Tribune). This Library is also a proof of why McGhee was one of the top Southern Buisnessmen. To provide the library with a steady income, the first floor could be rented out as a commercial space. This prevented the need for wealthly individuals to sponsor the library.</p>

								<br /> <br />
								<p>After the war, McGhee and a few other investors purchased the East Tennessee and Georgia Railroad and the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad. A few years later these men consolidated the two lines and formed the East Tennessee, Virginia, and Georgia Railroad (ETV&amp;G). After this the company rapidily expanded to, in literally terms, new horizons. In 1869 the company bough the Knoxville and Kentucky Railroad, Memphis and Charleston Railroad, the Georgia Southern Railroad, and the Mancon and Brunswick Railroad. These combonation of tracks became later known as the 'Southern Railway' as it connected the majority of the south up to the southern boarders of Ohio.</p>
								<br /> <br />
								<p>Another notable venture of Charles M. McGhee was the establishment of the Peopleâ€™s Bank of Knoxville. Established in 1865 this venture proved McGhee still had a substantial fortune from the plantation he inherited from his father. After the establishment of the bank, McGhee was named president of the bank; he organized the banking and commission business starting in 1865 in New York as C. Powell, Green &amp; Co.</p>
